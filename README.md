# Artificial Intelligence Co-Piloted Auditing

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the *Artificial Intelligence Co-Piloted Auditing* research paper. This repository houses the prompt protocols implemented in our experiments, demonstrating the collaborative auditing tasks accomplished by auditors and foundation models.

Our paper, *Artificial Intelligence Co-Piloted Auditing*, explores a new paradigm in the auditing profession, where auditors and foundation models collaborate, leveraging their distinct strengths:

- The foundation model, with its proficiency in handling extensive non-client specific exogenous data (e.g., financial news, financial reports, satellite imagery), offers a broad knowledge base and multi-tasking capabilities. It discerns patterns, conducts preliminary assessments or projections from large data sets, thereby enriching the auditor's decision-making process.

- The auditor, conversely, applies professional judgment and a deep understanding of client-specific endogenous data (e.g., journal entries, bank statements, contracts) for contextual interpretation and application of widely accepted audit principles, thereby guiding the foundation model's analysis and knowledge application.

This work reflects early work-in-progress. We very much welcome feedback and comments. The authors are responsible for the content creation, while GPT-4 (ChatGPT) has been employed in the proofreading.

## Repository Structure

This repository encompasses three distinct prompt protocols used in our experiments:

1. `Prompt_Protocol_A.md`: Fine-tuning protocol for the GPT-4 model, targeting financial ratio analysis.
2. `Prompt_Protocol_B.md`: Fine-tuning protocol for the GPT-4 model, focusing on post-implementation review.
3. `Prompt_Protocol_C.md`: Fine-tuning protocol for the GPT-4 model, aiming at detecting anomalies in journal entry data.

Each protocol presents comprehensive instructions for auditors to interact with the foundation model, guiding the ChatGPT interaction from task initiation to completion.

## Usage

To utilize these protocols, follow the instructions detailed in each file. They have been designed to guide you through the interaction process with OpenAI's GPT-4 foundation model.

## Contributions

We warmly welcome your contributions and feedback! Feel free to suggest your own prompt protocols, raise issues, or submit pull requests.
