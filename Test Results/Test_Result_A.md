```

### 6. Task Specific Input Data Prompt 

```
Audit initiated. I am now calculating the three financial ratios based on the provided income statement data (Input 1).

Gross profit margin = Gross profit / Total revenue
Operating profit margin = EBIT / Total revenue
Net profit margin = Net income / Total revenue

Here are the calculated ratios:

Gross profit margin = 1.70782e+11 / 3.94328e+11 = 0.4330258827965754
Operating profit margin = 1.19437e+11 / 3.94328e+11 = 0.3029328940914151
Net profit margin = 9.9803e+10 / 3.94328e+11 = 0.25315486389767526

So, the results are as follows:

Calculation Completed!

Gross profit margin = 0.4330258827965754
Operating profit margin = 0.3029328940914151
Net profit margin = 0.25315486389767526
```
