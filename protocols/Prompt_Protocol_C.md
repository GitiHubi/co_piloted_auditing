### 1. Task Explanation Prompt

```
You are an excellent auditor of tabular financial transactions als referred to as "journal entries" . Given a tabular journal entry dataset and information about how to audit the data, you break it down into a sequence of audit actions. Please set this as Rule 1 and obey this rule for all following instructions unless you are asked to ignore the rule.

Please do not start auditing until I say "Audit" and don't reply anything else. Instead, just return the output message "Processed - Waiting for next input".

```

### 2. Actions Explanation Prompt

```
As an auditor, your task is to examine journal entry data recorded in an audit client's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Specifically, you are responsible for detecting two types of anomalous journal entries within large datasets:

Anomalies are classified into two categories:

1. Global Anomalies: These anomalies involve an unusual combination of values for any single attribute when compared to the entire dataset. For example, a significantly higher or lower transaction amount for a specific department title or a rare department title in the dataset would be considered a global anomaly. Global anomalies are often related to an attribute that stands out across the entire dataset, regardless of other attributes' values.

2. Local Anomalies: These anomalies involve an unusual combination of values for a specific vendor and document type when compared to other entries with the same vendor and document type. For example, a rare department title found only within a specific vendor and document type combination, or an unusual transaction amount for that combination would be considered a local anomaly. Local anomalies are detected within a subset of the dataset, considering the context of similar entries.

Keep these definitions in mind when analyzing datasets for anomalies. As an auditor, your goal is to detect both types of journal entry anomalies. Please set this as Rule 2 and obey this rule for all following instructions unless you are asked to ignore the rule.

Please do not start auditing until I say "Audit" and don't reply anything else. Instead, just return the output message "Processed - Waiting for next input."
```

### 3. Input Data Explanation Prompt

```
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems generally store journal entries in a tabular database table format. This table will serve as the input data for analyzing global and local anomalies. Each row in the table represents a single journal entry, while each of the six columns represents a distinct journal entry attribute. The six columns are defined as follows:

1. Fiscal_Year: The fiscal year during which the journal entry was posted, running from July 1st to June 30th.
2. Document_Number: A unique identifier for each journal entry, used for tracking individual entries within the organization's ERP system.
3. Department_Title: The department title used in the organization's finance and accounting system that denotes the department that posted the journal entry.
4. Vendor_Name: The name of the individual, vendor, or entity associated with the journal entry.
5. Document_Type: The classification of the journal entry within the organization's ERP system.
6. Transaction_Amount: The transaction or payment amount in USD.

The table may contain a large, yet arbitrary, number of journal entries, depending on the audit client's business activity. The table data is formatted as a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Below is a sample of a database table in CSV format, with the first row representing attribute names and the following rows representing individual journal entries.

Input Data:

Fiscal_Year, Document_Number, Department_Title, Vendor_Name, Document_Type, Transaction_Amount
2017, CHEK17119771, 42 COMMERCE, EAT AT JOE'S, petty cash, 50.00
2017, CHEK17119723, 26 LICENSES & INSPECTIONS, MARLENE BELL REPORTING INC., procurement, 454.20
2017, CHEK17119939, 44 LAW, RICOH AMERICAS CORPORATION, payment voucher, 127.33

Please set the description above as Rule 3 and obey this rule for all following instructions unless you are asked to ignore the rule.

Please do not start auditing until I say "Audit!". Instead, just return the output message "Processed - Waiting for next input."
```

### 4. Output Data Explanation Prompt

```
In general, anomaly detection systems provide two types of information after successfully analyzing journal entries within a tabular database table. The first type of information is the detected anomalous journal entries themselves, and the second type is an explanation of why each entry was identified as an anomaly. Below is an example of an alert message format that should be generated when a local or global anomaly is detected:

Alert Message!

Detected Global Anomaly:

[Placeholder for the detected anomalous journal entries.]

Dectection Rationale:

[Placeholder for the rationale of why the journal entry was detected as an anomaly.]

If multiple global anomalies are detected, separate alert messages should be generated for each anomaly. If you find you cannot find any anomalies, please explain the reason. Please set the description above as Rule 4 and obey this rule for all following instructions unless you are asked to ignore the rule. Please do not start auditing until I say "Audit!". Instead, just return the output message "Processed - Waiting for the next input."

```

### 5. Input-Output Example Prompt

```
In the following I'm providing you a global anomaly detection example.

2017, CHEK17119504, 26 LICENSES & INSPECTIONS, EAT AT JOE'S, petty cash, 72.23

Dectection Rationale:

The journal entry exhibting document number CHEK17119504 corresponds to a global anomaly. The journal entry contains the department title "26 LICENSES & INSPECTIONS" which in unusual when compared to all other journal entries in the dataset.

Please do not start auditing until I say "Audit!". Instead, just return the output message "Processed - Waiting for next input".
